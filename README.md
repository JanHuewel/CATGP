# CATGP

This repository contains the code for our submission on CATGP - Component Analysis in Time Series with Gaussian Processes (Link to  be added)

CATGP is an algorithm that finds frequent components and component combinations in a set of GP models. It uses the Apriori principle for efficiency and can be applied to large databases.
